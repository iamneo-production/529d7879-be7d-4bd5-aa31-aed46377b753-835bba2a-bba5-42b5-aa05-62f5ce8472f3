    How does the LMS handle cataloging and organizing books?
    </p>
    <div className="faq-arrow" />
    <p className="faq-text">
       <br />
      <br />
      LMSs typically use standardized cataloging systems like MARC (Machine-Readable Cataloging) to classify and organize books. Librarians can enter book details, assign categories, and set keywords to facilitate efficient searching.

      <br />
      Most LMSs offer integration capabilities, allowing you to import existing library data into the system. This ensures a smooth transition and minimizes data entry.

      The process of migrating to a new LMS involves data conversion, testing, and training. It's essential to work closely with your chosen LMS provider, and they can guide you through the migration process.
